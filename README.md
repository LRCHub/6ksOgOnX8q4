[00:19.89] If you dance, I'll dance
[00:24.48] And if you don't, I'll dance anyway
[00:29.32] Give peace a chance
[00:34.12] Let the fear you have fall away
[00:49.62] 
[00:38.48] I've got my eye on you
[00:43.28] I've got my eye on you
[00:54.28] 
[00:48.50] Say yes to Heaven
[00:53.40] Say yes to me
[00:58.16] Say yes to Heaven
[01:03.03] Say yes to me
[01:09.53] 
[01:07.86] If you go, I'll stay
[01:12.72] You come back, I'll be right here
[01:17.45] Like a barge at sea
[01:22.35] In the storm, I stay clear
[01:35.35] 
[01:26.38] 'Cause I've got my mind on you
[01:31.37] I've got my mind on you
[01:42.87] 
[01:36.66] Say yes to Heaven
[01:41.47] Say yes to me
[01:46.16] Say yes to Heaven
[01:51.02] Say yes to me
[01:57.52] 
[02:15.01] If you dance, I'll dance
[02:19.35] I'll put my red dress on, get it on
[02:24.24] And if you fight, I'll fight
[02:29.19] It doesn't matter, now it's all gone
[02:47.19] 
[02:33.65] I've got my mind on you
[02:38.59] I got my mind on you
[02:48.59] 
[02:43.72] Say yes to Heaven
[02:48.68] Say yes to me
[02:53.43] Say yes to Heaven
[02:58.18] Say yes to me
[03:04.68] 
[03:02.45] I've got my eye on you
[03:07.23] I've got my eye on you, mm
[03:12.17] I've got my eye on you
[03:16.87] I've got my eye on you
